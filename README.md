# SOC Home Lab Documentation

## Overview
This repository documents the creation, configuration, and ongoing experiments of my **SOC (Security Operations Center) home lab**.  
The lab is designed as a safe, isolated environment for practicing both **offensive** and **defensive** cybersecurity techniques, focusing on:

- **SOC simulation**
- **SIEM log analysis**
- **Malware analysis**

---

## Goals
- Build a functional SOC-style environment using virtual machines.
- Simulate attacks and monitor their detection.
- Develop skills in incident response and security monitoring.
- Document findings and lessons learned for future reference.

---

## Repository Structure
The repository will include:
- **Setup Documentation** – Step-by-step notes on lab architecture, configurations, and tools used.
- **Analysis Results** – SIEM queries, dashboards, and log analysis findings.
- **Malware Analysis Notes** – Controlled, documented experiments with malicious samples (in a safe, isolated lab environment).
- **SOC Simulations** – Scenarios demonstrating attack, detection, and response workflows.

---

## Current Lab Stack
- **Kali Linux** – Offensive testing platform (e.g., Nmap).
- **Windows 10 Pro** – Defensive endpoint with Sysmon and Splunk.
- **Isolated Network** – Host-Only segment for safe traffic simulation.

## Disclaimer
This project is for **educational purposes only**.  
All testing is performed in a closed, controlled environment with no connection to production systems or public networks.
